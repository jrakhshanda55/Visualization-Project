# Software Architecture Analysis Dashboard (GNNs + Graph Autoencoders)

An **interactive dashboard** for exploring and visualizing software architecture using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Graph Autoencoders (GAEs)**.  
The app allows you to analyze dependencies, view architectural structures, and train GNN-based models to learn software module representations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load and explore software dependency datasets  
- Visualize implemented and intended architectures  
- View module and dependency type distributions  
- Train **GAE** or **VGAE** models using **GCN** or **GAT** encoders  
- Compare 2D embedding projections using **UMAP** or **t-SNE**
